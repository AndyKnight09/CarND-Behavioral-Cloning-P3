Audacity > Self Driving Car > Term 1 > Project 3 - Behavioral Cloning

The [write up](./writeup_report.md) for this project contains a brief project report and the source can be found in the following files:

* [model.py](./model.py) - Creates, trains and saves the model
* [model.h5](./model.h5) - The trained model output from [model.py](./model.py)
* [drive.py](./drive.py) - Uses the trained model ([model.h5](./model.h5)) to autonomously drive the Udacity simulator
* [video.py](./video.py) - Converts output of the autonomous drive run into a video

Output videos of the model autonomously driving the simulator can be found here:

* [run1.mp4](./run1.mp4) - An autonomous lap around track 1
* [run2.mp4](./run2.mp4) - An autonomous lap around track 2
